            <h1>You are a detective who had a huge breakthrough in your hunt for a mass murderer. While rushing back to your office, however,
                a car crashes into you. When you wake up, you find yourself tied up to a chair and blindfolded in an underground, with the killer-your partner-in front of you.
                He tells you he's getting some tools and will be back. You realize he didn't tie you up properly and you can escape your binds.
